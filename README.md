# Summarize the project amd what problem it was solving:
The purpose of this program is to allow a user to analyze the purchase frequency
of a certain product and read/write files based on input. This program uses both 
Python and C++ to best analyze large amounts of data.

# What did you do particularly well?
I did a good job with my file work. I felt as it came natural to me which
made working with the rest of my code easier.

# Where could you enhance your code?
I could enhance my code specifically with the efficiency of my python code.
It has been a minute since I have worked with python so some of my code wasn't
as compressed as it could be.

# Which pieces of code did you find the most challenging to write and how did you overcome it?
The most challenging aspect of this project was working in both Python and C++
since it was, at times, disorienting to go back and forth. I overcame this by using
the provided resources and I found the zyBook in my previous Python class to be a
great refresher.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project really developed my problem solving ability and it was great to see 
how reliable and versatile programming languages are when combined. I know this
will be a big part of my future classes that may require different languages for
certain aspects of a project.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable and readable by making inline comments for 
anything that required a reader to think "What is the purpose of this?" which
helped guide me as well especially when I took breaks and came back.
