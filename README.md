The purpose of this program is to allow a user to analyze the purchase frequency
of a certain product and read/write files based on input.
This program uses both Python and C++ to best analyze large amounts of data.
The most challenging aspect of this project was making sure my C++ functions
worked and could call upon the python function associated with it.
This project really developed my problem solving ability and it was great
to see how reliable and versatile programming languages are.
